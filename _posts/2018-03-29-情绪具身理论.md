认知具身理论为我们提供了解读情绪加工的新视角。对情绪的感知与思考涉及 perceptual, somatovisceral（躯体内脏的）, and motoric reexperiencing（肌肉运动的）(合在一起统称为“具身”) of the relevant emotion in one’s self. 通过在实验室中对facial expression and posture的操纵来引发个体是情绪具身，会相应影响其对情绪信息的加工。例如，当信息接受者的情绪肢体表现与信息发出者的情绪语调具有一致性时，会促进他们的交流与理解；而不一致时则会损害。

#### 当你对世界微笑，世界也会对你微笑。

举几个例子：
1、	典型工作姿势VS拖沓随意的姿势，当听到有关之前成就测试的好消息时，前者感受到的自豪程度和情绪愉悦感都更高。
2、	呈现诱发积极VS消极情绪反应的图片，当图片出现，个体需要通过移动杆来做出反应（push away VS pull toward ）。被要求推杆的个体对消极图片反应更快，而被要求拉近杆的被试对积极图片反应更快。
3、	测试耳机质量，被试建立点头赞同，摇头不赞同的联系；测试耳机质量时，其桌前放置一致钢笔。其后，另一位主试向被试提供之前放置的钢笔或者另一只新的笔，结果点头的被试更喜欢那只旧的笔，而摇头的被试更喜欢新的。

这些研究都一致地表明：there is a reciprocal relationship between the bodily expression of emotion and the way in which emotional information is attended to and interpreted.

注：实验室中facial expression的操纵方法。(Top) In order to manipulate contraction of the brow muscle in a simulation of negative affect, researchers have affixed golf tees to the inside of participants’ eyebrows. Participants in whom negative emotion was induced were instructed to bring the ends of the golf tees together, as in the right panel. (Bottom) In other research, participants either held a pen between the lips to inhibit smiling, as in the left panel, or else held the pen between the teeth to facilitate smiling.



4、	达尔文对“attitude”的定义：a collection of motor behaviors (especially posture) that conveys an organism’s emotional response toward an object.

5、	(i) when individuals adopt emotion-specific postures, they report experiencing the associated emotions; (ii) when individuals adopt facial expressions or make emotional gestures, their preferences and attitudes are influenced; (iii) when individuals’ motor movements are inhibited, interference in the experience of emotion and processing of emotional information is observed.


大量心理学研究所关注的：情绪具身、情绪感知状态与我们对情绪相关信息的获取与使用之间的因果关系。The way to understand this relationship between bodily states of emotion and the manner in which humans encode, represent, and use emotional information is the topic of this article.


#### 具身认知理论
缺乏比较完整的情绪信息加工模型；对于许多科学家来说，情感似乎充满了太多的困难，不能被认为是一个易于理解的研究课题。

左：视觉、听觉、情感系统的激活(Left)
右：when remembering the appearance of the bear, parts of the original states of the visual system are reinstated. These then can act to reactivate the parts of the states that were originally active in the other systems.（一个系统中重新激活的神经元模式可以级联地激活在原始状态中的其他系统的模式）

——神经机制Later, in just thinking about stumbling on the bear, the neural states that represent (for example) the visual impression of the bear can be reactivated. The reinstantiation of a pattern of neurons in one system can then cascade to complete the full pattern in the others. Through the interconnections of the populations of neurons that were active during the original experience, a partial multimodal reenactment of the experience is produced (16, 17). Critically for such an account, one reason that only parts of the original neural states are reactivated is that attention is selectively focused on the aspects of the experience that are most salient and important for the individual. These then are the aspects that are most likely to be stored for later reactivation (12). Because emotions are salient and functional, this aspect of experience will certainly be preserved (8).

#### 情绪的感知
将具身认知理论应用到情绪上：对情绪信息的感知（识别面孔情绪或词语）—involves the embodiment of the implied emotion（多项实证证据）。
——recognizing a facial expression of emotion in another person and experiencing that emotion oneself involve overlapping neural circuits
——areas of the anterior insula and, to some extent, the ACC were activated both when individuals observed disgust in others and when they experienced disgust themselves

行为上：emotional expressions and gestures are visibly imitated by observers and that this imitation is accompanied by self-reports of the associated emotional state.
具身认知理论为此提供了理论上的解释：The imitation of other individuals’ emotional expressions is part of the bodily reenactment （再现）of the experience of the other’s state.
这也是共情的基础，有助于社会互动（孤独症患者无法进行。。）
这种个体间的emotional resonance在观察学习与指导学习中的重要意义！
1、observational learning is supported by a reenactment of the emotional experience of the model in the observer.
2、learning occurs through the transmission of language（自身和他人都没有对情绪的亲身体验）
3、Already published comparisons of amygdala activation during conditioned, observational, and instructed fear-learning in humans are consistent with just such a view
Thinking About Emotion
采用机电记录仪的研究（electromyographic recording）

![picture3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DJR007/DJR007.github.io/master/img/fig3.png)

In making their judgments, individuals embodied the relevant, discrete emotion as indicated by their facial expressions.
在转换代价中的证据?（此处没看懂）
individuals simulate objects in the relevant modalities when they use them in thought and language.
情绪语言的理解
过程：The first step in language comprehension, then, is to index words or phrases to embodied states that refer
to these objects. Next, the observer simulates possible interactions with the objects. Finally, the message is understood when a coherent set of actions is created.

**你带着笑容去读开心的东西，对它理解会更快。**
Reading times for understanding sentences describing pleasant events were faster when participants were smiling than times when particpants were prevented from smiling.（反之也成立）

总结：早期对认知具身理论的批判在于，身体上的反应太慢、太笼统了，其并不能反应个体的情绪体验。实际上，motor system alone 能够进行非常微妙的区别。但更重要的是，具身认知理论近来已经摆脱了此诟病 by focusing on the brain’s modality-specific systems而不仅仅是肌肉和内脏反应。The circuits in modality specific brain areas are fast, refined, and able to flexibly process a large number of states. These states can be reactivated without their output being observable in overt behavior. （即便没有观察到外显的行为输出，这些状态也是可以达到的！）This account is ripe, therefore, to generate research that can further the understanding of learning, language comprehension, psychotherapeutic techniques, and attitudes and prejudice, just to name a few psychological phenomena（意义所在）.

待完善。。。
